    <h2>Common Black Hawk</h2>
    <p>The common black hawk (Buteogallus anthracinus) is a bird of prey in the family Accipitridae, which also includes
      the eagles, hawks, and Old World vultures. The mangrove black hawk, traditionally thought to be a distinct
      species, is now generally considered a subspecies, B. a. subtilis, of the common black hawk.</p>
    <h3>Subbuteo</h3>
    <p>Subbuteo was invented by Peter Adolph (1916â€“1994), who was demobbed from the Royal Air Force after the end of
      World War II. Searching for a new business opportunity he turned his attention to creating a new table-top
      football game. He adapted his game from Newfooty, a table football game that had been invented in 1929 by William
      Lane Keeling of Liverpool. He made numerous improvements, including changing the heavy lead bases under the model
      players to lighter materials, using for his prototype a button from his mother's coat and a washer.</p>
    <h3>Vagus Nerve</h3>
    <p>The vagus nerve also plays a role in satiation following food consumption.

      Parasympathetic innervation of the heart is partially controlled by the vagus nerve and is shared by the thoracic
      ganglia. Vagal and spinal ganglionic nerves mediate the lowering of the heart rate. The right vagus branch
      innervates the sinoatrial node. In healthy people, parasympathetic tone from these sources are well-matched to
      sympathetic tone. Hyperstimulation of parasympathetic influence promotes bradyarrhythmias. When hyperstimulated,
      the left vagal branch predisposes the heart to conduction block at the atrioventricular node</p>

      <h3>Evolution of the anus</h3>
      <p>The development of the anus was an important stage in the evolution of multicellular animals. It appears to
        have happened at least twice, following different paths in protostomes and deuterostomes. This accompanied or
        facilitated other important evolutionary developments: the bilaterian body plan, the coelom, and metamerism, in
        which the body was built of repeated "modules" which could later specialize, such as the heads of most
        arthropods, which are composed of fused, specialized segments</p>

      <h3>Campagnolo</h3>
      <p>Campagnolo is an Italian manufacturer of bicycle components with headquarters in Vicenza, Italy. The components
        are organised as groupsets (gruppi), and are a near-complete collection of a bicycle's mechanical parts.
        Campagnolo's flagship components are the Super Record, Record, and Chorus groupsets that represent their recent
        shift to 11-speed drivetrains. Record and Super Record are the top groupsets, followed by Chorus, Potenza,
        Centaur and Veloce. Campagnolo also produces aluminum and carbon wheels, as well as other components (like
        carbon fiber seat posts, and bottle-cages)..</p>

    <h3>Colnago Bicycles</h3>
    <p>With a growing reputation from their racing wins, Colnago plunged into the market for production bikes. In the
      U.S., the early seventies witnessed another bike boom, and Colnago "pumped out bikes as though the future of
      humankind was at stake." The mainstay of the Colnago line in the 1970s was the Super, followed by the Mexico,
      named in honor of the successful hour attempt. Other models were added including the Superissimo and Esa Mexico.
      While the finish on these early Colnagos could be variable, they were great riding bikes and developed a cult-like
      following.</p>
